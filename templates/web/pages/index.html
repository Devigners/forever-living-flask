							times vary depending on where you live but should generally take
							no more than 3-5 business days after purchase. Finally, the prices of
							Forever Living products depend on which country they are being
							purchased in - some countries may have higher prices than others
							due to taxes or shipping costs involved in transporting the goods
							internationally.

						<h3>About Me and My FLP Journey</h3>
						<p>
							I am an experienced licensed dentist from India, completed my MBA
							with a conc. in Healthcare Administration from the USA and now
							working full-time as a drug safety project manager. I am also
							doing a residency in Dental Public Health in Boston, USA where I
							focus on population health in preventative and cost-effective
							ways. I strongly believe that the first step to staying healthy
							and living a longer life is to eat and drink healthy food.
							<br>
							<br>
							Joining Forever Living Products (FLP) can be an exciting new
							venture for many entrepreneurs. It is a health/wellness and beauty
							direct-selling product company that offers an entrepreneurial
							opportunity to those looking to start their own business from
							home.
							<br>
							<br>
							When I first heard about the FLP business opportunity from my
							manager, I knew that was something I wanted to explore further. I
							decided to do my research and learn more about the company, its
							products, and the process of becoming a distributor. I focused
							initially on just one of their products, Forever Bright Toothgel.
							I found that Forever Bright Toothgel is created using an advanced
							process that ensures all its natural minerals are retained during
							processing and contains no sugar or fluoride or harsh chemicals or
							artificial additives. That was enough to push me and join the FLP
							family and here I am!
							<br>
							<br>
							The process of joining FLP was straightforward and easy even back
							in the year 2011. After I was invited to FLP by my sponsor, all I
							had to do was fill out a simple application form online and choose
							a <b>starter 2cc kit</b> worth US$350 ("Start Your Journey Value Pak") to get started
							with my business. Once my application was approved, which didn’t
							take too long, I became an official FLP distributor/Forever Business
							Owner (FBO) right away!
