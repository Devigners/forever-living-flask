						<h3>My Journey of Joining FLP</h3>
						<p>
							Joining Forever Living Products (FLP) can be an exciting new
							venture for many entrepreneurs. It is a health/wellness and beauty
							direct-selling product company that offers an entrepreneurial
							opportunity to those looking to start their own business from
							home.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I first heard about the FLP business opportunity from my
							manager, I knew that was something I wanted to explore further. I
							decided to do my research and learn more about the company, its
							products, and the process of becoming a distributor. I focused
							initially on just one of their products, Forever Bright Toothgel.
							I found that Forever Bright Toothgel is created using an advanced
							process that ensures all its natural minerals are retained during
							processing and contains no sugar or fluoride or harsh chemicals or
							artificial additives. That was enough to push me and join the FLP
							family and here I am!
						</p>
						<p>
							The process of joining FLP was straightforward and easy even back
							in the year 2011. After I was invited to FLP by my sponsor, all I
							had to do was fill out a simple application form online and choose
							a starter kit worth US$400 to get started with my business. Once
							my application was approved, which didn’t take too long, I became
							an official FLP distributor right away!
