							About Forever Living Products Company
						</h3>
						<span class="text-heading">
							Forever Living is the world largest aloe vera company in the world. Forever was founded in 1978 here in Phoenix, Arizona by a young gentleman called Rex Maughan. Together with experts on aloe Rex found a way to harvest and stabilize aloe vera which was one of the key ingredients to success of Forever Living. Imagine that you can suddenly have a product available across the world that is practically identical to a fresh cut aloe vera leaf - unbelievable. Not only in United States but around the globe.
						</span>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xl-6">
								<p>
									Then, for a company to thrive for over 42 years there is got to be a very powerful leadership and that's another greatness that Rex invested into - great group of people who worked hard, smart, ethical and proved the world that you can build something great working together.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-xl-6">
								<p class="mb--0">
									Finally, true success of Forever Living Products is based on how products are distributed, promoted and provided to clients - which is quite different than a traditional way.
